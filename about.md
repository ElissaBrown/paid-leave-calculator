Unexpected health problems in ourselves and family members are an unfortunate reality that can require extended time away from work.  Likewise, new parents often need time to adjust to their new lives.  These issues affect everyone, men and women, alike.  Family leave programs are in place to protect the rights of workers, when they need to take extended leave to care for a new child or a sick loved one.  

The three states that offer paid family leave finance it through payroll taxes that pay into the states’ existing temporary disability insurance programs. Another state, Washington, which does not have temporary disability insurance, approved paid family leave in 2007 but has not started the program for financial reasons. At California companies, many of which lobbied against the law, fears about its effects have not played out. From 89 percent to 99 percent of employers say it has had no effect or a positive one on productivity, profitability, turnover and morale, according to a report by Ms. Milkman and Eileen Appelbaum, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Eighty-seven percent say it has not increased costs. Nine percent say they saved money, because of decreased turnover or benefit payments.

Paid leave programs provide many benefits to workers blah blah.  Despite these facts, the United States remains the only industrialized country in the world to not require employers provide paid leave programs to their employees.  We knows that paid leave provides benefits to workers during during challenging times in their lives, but at what cost to the employer?  Washington's FAMLI Act will provide income when workers must take extended leaves of up to 12 weeks for the birth or adoption of a child, or the serious health condition of the worker or a close family member, financed through low-cost payroll premiums.  Based on industry values, the attrition rate when no paid leave is offered is 33%. That is, a third of those who take unpaid leave will not return to work once their leave is complete. While the effects of offering paid leave on attrition are not always easy to ascertain, we know that companies such as Google have seen their attrition rate among new mothers halved after increasing paid leave to 18 weeks.  This is where cost savings are generated.

> Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.

The Cost of Hire is a tech-specific number generated by JDA Professional Services, a staffing service specializing in the IT industry [ref]. For an employee with a salary of $60,000/yr, JDA estimates that the cost to replace is $150,000. As the salary of the position being replaces grows,
so does the cost of replacing the employee. Replacing an employee with an salary of $100,000/yr can cost as much as $169,000.  The cost of replacing an employee takes into account various direct and indirect expenses.  Among the costs that go into replacing an employee are the cost of the candidate search, relocation, sign-on bonuses, training, and the loss of institutional knowledge and productivity. Every enterprise is different, and some costs may be more applicable to some than to others, but the formula from JDA provides a solid starting point.

|                     | No Paid Leave | Paid Leave   |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Number taking leave |       12      |      12      |
| Number returning    |       8       |      10      |
| Number no returning | 4 (33%)       | 2 (17%)      |
| Cost of replacement | 4 x $169,064  | 2 x $169,064 |
| Cost of benefits    | $0            | 12 x $17,753 |
| Total costs         | $676,256      | $551,169     |
| Savings with paid leave | | $125,087     |

### Where do the values come from?

A great thing about the calculator is that you don't have to stick with our values.  You can set your own values and explore how the costs change with different settings.  We work in technology so the technology industry was the focus of the tool.  The default values set in the calculator primarily come from an article about the cost of hiring from [JDA Professional Services](http://www.jdapsi.com/client/articles/coh).  We've replicated 

| Possible direct costs | | Dollar |
|------:|:-----|---------|
| *Job ads* | |
| | Develop description, write posting, get approvals, & post to job boards (5 hrs x $100/hr) | 500 | 
| | Run a 2-week ad on Monster | 100 | 
| | Handle/screen responses & schedule interviews (10 hrs x $100/hr) | 1,000 | 
| *Recruitment costs* | |
| | Interviewing costs (7 candidates x 3 hrs ea x $100/hr) | 2,100 | 
| | External recruiting fees (1.1*salary x 33%) | 22,176 | 
| | Pre-employment testing/reference check | 1,000 | 
| *Offer package* | |
| | Salary increase (salary x 10%) | 7,200 | 
| | Sign-on bonus (1.1*salary x 5%) | 3,360 | 
| | Relocation | 5,000 | 
| | Training (30 days x 2hrs/day x $100/hour + $1,000) | 7,000 |

| Possible indirect costs | Dollar |

| Additional stress on management | $12,000 |
| Consulting fees | $18,000 |
| Overtime expense| $5,640 |
| **Total inirect costs** | **$100,564** | 

> Many companies shy away from the idea of implementing a formal retention plan because they fear it will cost too much and take too much effort, but could that tedious and sometimes costly process really save the company time and money in the long run?

### Simulating a workforce
 
When you change calculator values using the sliders, behind the scenes simulations compute the costs.  First, the salaries are randomly generated from a normal distribution based on the average salary you set.  Of all your employees taking leave, a random subset are selected to not return and the proportion of non-returners varies depending on the benefits offered.  30 independent simulations are run every time you change a slider value and the costs are averaged across those simulations and visualized in the calculator.  If you're interested in exploring the internals of the calculator, download the R code from our GitHub repo.
