Washington's FAMLI Act will provide income when workers must take extended leaves of up to 12 weeks for the birth or adoption of a child, or the serious health condition of the worker or a close family member, financed through low-cost payroll premiums.  Based on industry values, the attrition rate when no paid leave is offered is 33%. That is, a third of those who take unpaid leave will not return to work once their leave is complete. While the effects of offering paid leave on attrition are not always easy to ascertain, we know that companies such as Google have seen their attrition rate among new mothers halved after increasing paid leave to 18 weeks.  This is where cost savings are generated.

The Cost of Hire is a tech-specific number generated by JDA Professional Services, a staffing service specializing in the IT industry [ref]. For an employee with a salary of $60,000/yr, JDA estimates that the cost to replace is $150,000. As the salary of the position being replaces grows,
so does the cost of replacing the employee. Replacing an employee with an salary of $100,000/yr can cost as much as $169,000.  The cost of replacing an employee takes into account various direct and indirect expenses.  Among the costs that go into replacing an employee are the cost of the candidate search, relocation, sign-on bonuses, training, and the loss of institutional knowledge and productivity. Every enterprise is different, and some costs may be more applicable to some than to others, but the formula from JDA provides a solid starting point.

|                     | No Paid Leave | Paid Leave   |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Number taking leave |       12      |      12      |
| Number returning    |       8       |      10      |
| Number no returning | 4 (33%)       | 2 (17%)      |
| Cost of replacement | 4 x $169,064  | 2 x $169,064 |
| Cost of benefits    | $0            | 12 x $17,753 |
| Total costs         | $676,256      | $551,169     |
| Savings with paid leave | | $125,087     |

### Where do the values come from?

A great thing about the calculator is that you don't have to stick with our values.  You can set your own values and explore how the costs change with different settings.  We work in technology so the technology industry was the focus of the tool.  The default values set in the calculator primarily come from an article about the cost of hiring from [JDA Professional Services](http://www.jdapsi.com/client/articles/coh).  We've replicated 

| Possible direct costs | | Dollar |
|------:|:-----|---------|
| *Job ads* | |
| | Develop description, write posting, get approvals, & post to job boards (5 hrs x $100/hr) | 500 | 
| | Run a 2-week ad on Monster | 100 | 
| | Handle/screen responses & schedule interviews (10 hrs x $100/hr) | 1,000 | 
| *Recruitment costs* | |
| | Interviewing costs (7 candidates x 3 hrs ea x $100/hr) | 2,100 |

> Many companies shy away from the idea of implementing a formal retention plan because they fear it will cost too much and take too much effort, but could that tedious and sometimes costly process really save the company time and money in the long run?

### Simulating a workforce
 
When you change calculator values using the sliders, behind the scenes simulations compute the costs.  First, the salaries are randomly generated from a normal distribution based on the average salary you set.  Of all your employees taking leave, a random subset are selected to not return and the proportion of non-returners varies depending on the benefits offered.  30 independent simulations are run every time you change a slider value and the costs are averaged across those simulations and visualized in the calculator.  If you're interested in exploring the internals of the calculator, download the R code from our GitHub repo.
