## Simulating a workforce
 
When you change calculator values using the sliders, behind the scenes simulations compute the costs.  First, the salaries are randomly generated from a normal distribution based on the average salary you set.  Of all your employees taking leave, a random subset are selected to not return and the proportion of non-returners varies depending on the benefits offered.  30 independent simulations are run every time you change a slider value and the costs are averaged across those simulations and visualized in the calculator.  If you're interested in exploring the internals of the calculator, download the R code from our GitHub repo.
